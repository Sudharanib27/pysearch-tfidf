This repository contains data mining toy search engine developed from scratch using python
PySearch is a toy search engine implemented in Python. The code reads a US Inaugural Addresses corpus and produces TF-IDF vectors for documents in the corpus. Using these vectors, it calculates the cosine similarity scores between a given query string and the documents in the corpus. Finally, it returns the document with the highest cosine similarity score as the query answer.
